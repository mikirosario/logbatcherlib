Versión 0.7

- All logs, or only JSON logs, can now be deleted from disk after being read from file.

- All Logger exceptions are now handled with an error message written to the console.

- All log files now have the extension .log and are numbered starting from 1 in the format: logs.log,
logs1.log, logs2.log, etc.
